        <p>
            Currently, there are 39 million blind and 246 million visually challenged people. They have hard time without the help of other people. For example, not everyone can stay at home alone, if not all things are in a certain place. How will they find water if the carafe is over? How to eat if the food is not there?
        </p><p>
            <b>Orama</b> (from Greek: <i>Όραμα</i>, meaning "<i>vision</i>") is an app made to help visually impaired people with the use of <i>artificial intelligence</i>.It detects and announces needed for the user objects through the phone's camera.
        </p><p>
            The essence of this project is to help blind people to become more independent by using artificial intelligence, namely computer vision. By becoming more independent, our project still helps relatives of blind people.

            In 2020 Orama is participating in <a href="https://www.curiositymachine.org/about/">Technovation Family</a> that will be held at MIT the following summer.

            Right now <i>Orama Demo</i> is available. You can check it out from either your computer or your phone. To open Orama, press the <a id='app_link'>following link</a>. It works offline!
        </p><p>
            To install the app press the install or add to homescreen  button in the top right corner, and confirm the installation. This may vary depending on the browser.

            Orama Demo can identify up to 4 objects from a 1-1.5 meter distance with an accuracy of 97%! In the future, we plan on increasing the amount of item classes and more tests will be conducted for better user case.
        </p><p>
            Even though, these results are good, it doesn't make any value for the blind yet because from a distance of 1-1.5 meters they can find things with their bare hands.

            In order to improve Orama, training photos are required. Although we can produce photos by ourselves, the amount and variety of photos we can provide is limited. This is where you play a major role.
        </p><p>
            <i><u>This will take you less than a minute!</u></i> If you wish to help, you can contribute photos to the dataset with the following steps:
        </p><ol>    
            <li>Take 5 pictures of your surroundings (infront, behind,  left, right, and under you)</li>
            <!-- <center>
                <div class="example"><img src='/app/images/examples/hat.jpg'><center>Hat</center></div>
                <div class="example"><img src='/app/images/examples/plate.jpg'><center>Plate</center></div>

                <div class="example"><img src='/app/images/examples/background.jpg'><center>Nothing</center></div>
            </center> -->
            <i>The quality of the photos is not vital.</i>
            <li>Then mail them to us at <a href="mailto:13nurmukhambetovm@haileyburyalmaty.kz">13nurmukhambetovm@haileyburyalmaty.kz</a></li>

            “Our youngest daughter, Sofia, drove us to create this project. Sofia, was born prematurely, from birth we fought for her life, they tried as much as possible to save her eyesight. In consequence of 12 operations, we were able to save Sofia's light perception. But this is not enough, in order to live a full-fledged life on her own, she needs outside help.”<br>
